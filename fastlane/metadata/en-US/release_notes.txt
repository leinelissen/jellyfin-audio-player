Fintunes now supports displaying lyrics so you can sign along to your favourite tunes! Also, you can now use Fintunes as a client for Emby. Minor features in this release include:

• Cover images being saved for downloaded tracks (re-download your tracks to make sure they appear)
• A display that shows codec information for your currently playing tracks
• Loads of new translations, such as Polish, Tamil, Traditional Chinese, Finnish and Indonesian. Thanks to all language contributors!

v2.4.2 contains a fix for an error introduced with v2.4.0 that prohibited downloading tracks without cover art.
